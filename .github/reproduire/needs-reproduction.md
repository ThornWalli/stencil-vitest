We need a minimal reproduction to be able to triage this issue.

### Why do we need a minimal reproduction?

Reproductions help us identify the source of the problem and verify that the issue is not caused by something specific to your project.

### How can I create a reproduction?

Please use our starter template to create a minimal reproduction:

| Template    | Link                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CodeSandbox | [stencil-starter-vitest](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnjenkins/stencil-starter-vitest) |
| GitHub      | [stencil-starter-vitest](https://github.com/johnjenkins/stencil-starter-vitest)              |

> **Note:** Browser tests will not work in a CodeSandbox container. If your issue relates to browser testing, please fork the GitHub repo and run locally.

A reproduction should be **as minimal as possible** - remove any code not directly related to the issue.

### What happens next?

- If you provide a valid reproduction link, this issue will be triaged and addressed based on priority.
- If no reproduction is provided within **7 days**, this issue may be automatically closed.
- You can always reopen the issue by providing a reproduction link.
